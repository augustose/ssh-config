# SSH Configuration Manager

A collection of scripts to easily manage SSH connections from the command line.

**Each script maintains its own version number, hardcoded at the top of the file. To update the version, simply edit the script and change the version string.**

## 📋 Description

This project includes two main scripts:

- **`ssh-config`**: SSH configuration manager to add, edit, list and comment connections
- **`ssh-connect`**: Interactive SSH connector with filters and visual selection

## 🚀 Features

### ssh-config
- ✅ Add new SSH configurations
- ✅ Edit existing configurations
- ✅ List all configurations
- ✅ Comment/uncomment configurations
- ✅ Edit configuration file directly
- ✅ Intuitive command line interface

### ssh-connect
- ✅ Interactive mode with colorful interface
- ✅ Filter connections by name
- ✅ Numeric server selection
- ✅ Connection details visualization
- ✅ Real-time search
- ✅ List-only mode
- ✅ Parallel connections with multiple terminal windows
- ✅ Tmux integration with split panes
- ✅ Command broadcasting to multiple servers
- ✅ Interactive multi-server mode

## 🔧 Configuration

### SSH Configuration File

The scripts use the standard SSH configuration file located at:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.ssh/config`

If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically with correct permissions.

### Initial Setup

To get started quickly, you can use the included example file:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp ssh-config.example ~/.ssh/config

# Edit with your real configurations
ssh-config -e
```

### Configuration File Structure

```bash
Host server-name
    HostName example.com
    User username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ForwardAgent yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60
```

## 🔒 Security

- Scripts respect SSH configuration file permissions
- File `~/.ssh/config` is created with `600` permissions (read-only for owner)
- Directory `~/.ssh` is created with `700` permissions if it doesn't exist
- No passwords or sensitive information are stored
- **Important**: Never share your real `~/.ssh/config` file as it may contain sensitive information
